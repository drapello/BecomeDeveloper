# Development Environement

The Develepment Environement is about the collection of tools and processes all the developers should do in order to work in a collaborative work place.

As part of the development environement all the developers should have and/or know:

  - A basic knowledge on operating systems
  - A programing language
  - Version control system 
  - A package manager
  - Environement control system
  - IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

# Basic knowledge of operating systems

## The Terminal
Basically when dealing with operating systems we have to approaches to excute comands and tasks:
1) From the graphical user interface (GUI).
2) From the terminal.

Why stick to terminal?
1) Not everything has a GUI.
2) Sometimes the GUI is badly designed. With Terminals, you won't need to look through stupid tabs and menus trying to find a button that looks like it will do what you are trying to do.
3) The terminal is keyboard only, no need to use your mouse.

Getting used to the terminal is a bit complicated at first, but once you are used to it, you won't be able to remember how your life used to be before using it.

### In Windows you can open the terminal by excuting the command CMD from your Start Menu Search!

## Basic comands

When we are programing, there are basic commands we have to know to deal with operating systems such as:

    list, create, delete directories 

### In Windows you can perform these tasks as following:

    dir <DIRECTORY> - List the content of the specified directory
    md <DIRECTORY> - create a directory
    cd <DIRECTORY> - Get into the directory
    cd .. - Get out of a directory and goes to the external level
    rmdir <DIRECTORY> - Delete a directory

# A programing language
There are many types of programming languages, sometimes a programing language follow a programing paradigma, but sometimes the are created multipurpose.

Python is a programming language that supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. 

Learn more about it here: https://www.python.org/

Installing python: 
https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/

after you run the installer you shoud type on your terminal:

    python --version
    
and you should get the version of the python installed on your computer

    Python 2.7.10

when you run pyhton on your terminal by typing python and pressing enter, you should get the following python prompt:

    Python 2.7.10 (default, Feb 22 2019, 21:55:15) 
    [GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 10.0.1 (clang-1001.0.37.14)] on darwin
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> 

from here you can start basic operations such as:

    >>> A = 5
    >>> B = 6
    >>> print("The some of A plus B is %s" % str(A+B))
    The some of A plus B is 11
